Voice-Controlled Virtual Assistant (Alexa Clone)
Overview

This project is a Python-based voice-controlled virtual assistant that interprets spoken commands and performs predefined tasks using speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. The system enables hands-free interaction for common utilities such as playing media, retrieving information, and responding conversationally.

The application demonstrates practical implementation of speech processing, automation, and basic natural language command handling.

Key Features

Voice command recognition using microphone input

Text-to-speech response generation

Media playback on YouTube through voice commands

Real-time clock reporting

Information retrieval from Wikipedia

Random joke generation

Voice-controlled termination of the application

System Workflow

The system continuously listens for user input through the microphone.

Speech is converted to text using Google Speech Recognition.

Commands are parsed based on predefined keywords.

Corresponding actions are executed.

Responses are delivered through text-to-speech output.

Supported Voice Commands

“Alexa play <song name>”

“Alexa what is the time”

“Alexa who is <person name>”

“Alexa tell me a joke”

“Alexa stop”
